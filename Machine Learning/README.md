# Machine Learning
Lot' of Defination is available on internet, I'm following these two definations

#### 1. Authur Semuel, 1959
```diff
Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
```

#### 2. Tom Mitchell, 1998
```diff
A computer programmed is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task and some performance measure p, if it's 
performance on T, measure by P, improved with experience E.
```

### Machine Learning Pipeline

Machine Learning pipeline divided in four phases
#### Phase 1. Data Processing
```diff
This is where you format data in way algorithms can ingest. Uses Linear Algebra
```
#### Phase 2. Feature Engineering and Selection
```diff
This is where transform data to make it easy for algorithm to understand. Uses Vectors and matrices.
```
#### Phase 3. Modeling
```diff
This is where you define the problem in a way the algorithm can optimize. Uses probability, geometry, norms and statistics.
```
#### Phase 4. Optimization
```diff
This is where you iterate until certain condition are met, and then you chose the best model. Uses Vector calculus.
```
